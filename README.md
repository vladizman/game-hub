#Game-Hub

This project is a modest recreation of the rawg.io website, which serves as a video game database and discovery platform. 
I've also utilized their API key to display games on my local project. Users can sort games by genre or platform, utilize the search bar, and toggle between light and dark modes.


While creating this project, I encountered some challenges, such as working with the Chakra UI library because I was not familiar with its documentation. 
However, in the end, I learned many new things, such as how to fetch games, create custom hooks, build and maintain game cards, and connect with the backend. 
I learned terms like Axios, Effect hook, HTTP requests and responses, and side effects. Additionally, I picked up various techniques to enhance the user 
interface and improve user experience, such as implementing loading skeletons, displaying a spinner during data loading, handling games without images, and more.
